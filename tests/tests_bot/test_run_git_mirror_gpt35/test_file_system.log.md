System: You are an excellent python pytest unit test engineer. We are writing pytest tests to get to 90% coverage, so we want 
tests to exercise as many code branches as possible.

First, begin by looking for bugs. There might not be any bugs. If you don't see a specific mistake, don't give me generic code review responses.

Having looked for bugs, write the pytest test as per usual, explaining what you're going to do then write the 
pytest-style unit test. Don't forget to write code!

## Tooling
Use pytest style testing. Use unittest.mock for mocking. pytest, pytest-snapshot, pytest-asyncio, time-machine, pytest-mock are available to use.

Do not, under any circumstances, use unittest.TestCase.

The target python version is 3.10

## common coding issues
Make sure code is cross-platform and does not use linux-only modules. Prefer pathlib.Path whenever possible. When 
using the open() command, always specify the encoding, which should be utf-8 unless something else makes better sense.

## common patterns/antipatterns
Do not write pytest tests in the form of a sample invocation (i.e. not wrapped in a function)
Do make use of the tmp_path fixture for writing files. Do not mock `open` to avoid writing files.

## Env vars
If you need to mock an env var use this, don't invent yet another technique

```
from tests.env_util import temporary_env_var

with temporary_env_var("NAME", "mock_value", "NAME2", "mock_value2"):
	assert os.environ["NAME"] == "mock_value"
	assert os.environ["NAME2"] == "mock_value2"
```

Library is named git_mirror.

```python
import os

from platformdirs import user_cache_dir, user_config_dir, user_data_dir


def setup_app_directories(app_name: str):
    # Define the directory paths for config, data, and cache
    config_dir = user_config_dir(app_name)
    data_dir = user_data_dir(app_name)
    cache_dir = user_cache_dir(app_name)

    # Create the directories if they don't already exist
    for directory in [config_dir, data_dir, cache_dir]:
        os.makedirs(directory, exist_ok=True)

    # Define the path for the SQLite database file in the data directory
    sqlite_file_path = os.path.join(data_dir, f"{app_name}.sqlite")

    return {
        "config_dir": config_dir,
        "data_dir": data_dir,
        "cache_dir": cache_dir,
        "sqlite_file_path": sqlite_file_path,
    }


```
Please write some unit tests for E:\github\git_mirror\git_mirror\file_system.py. If you can't think of anymore unit tests, write "No more unit tests".
Assistant: 1. We need to test if the directories are created correctly when `setup_app_directories` is called.
2. We should also check if the SQLite file path is correctly constructed.
3. Additionally, we can test what happens when `os.makedirs` fails for some reason.
4. We should test with different input values to cover multiple scenarios.

Here are the unit tests for the `file_system.py` module:

```python
import os
from git_mirror.file_system import setup_app_directories
from unittest.mock import patch

def test_setup_app_directories(mocker):
    app_name = "my_app"

    config_dir = "config_dir_path"
    data_dir = "data_dir_path"
    cache_dir = "cache_dir_path"

    with patch("git_mirror.file_system.user_config_dir", return_value=config_dir), \
         patch("git_mirror.file_system.user_data_dir", return_value=data_dir), \
         patch("git_mirror.file_system.user_cache_dir", return_value=cache_dir), \
         patch("git_mirror.file_system.os.makedirs") as mock_makedirs:
        
        result = setup_app_directories(app_name)

        assert result["config_dir"] == config_dir
        assert result["data_dir"] == data_dir
        assert result["cache_dir"] == cache_dir
        assert result["sqlite_file_path"] == os.path.join(data_dir, f"{app_name}.sqlite")
        mock_makedirs.assert_called_with(config_dir, exist_ok=True)
        mock_makedirs.assert_called_with(data_dir, exist_ok=True)
        mock_makedirs.assert_called_with(cache_dir, exist_ok=True)

def test_setup_app_directories_os_error(mocker):
    app_name = "my_app"

    with patch("git_mirror.file_system.user_config_dir"), \
         patch("git_mirror.file_system.user_data_dir"), \
         patch("git_mirror.file_system.user_cache_dir"), \
         patch("git_mirror.file_system.os.makedirs", side_effect=OSError):
        
        result = setup_app_directories(app_name)

        assert result["config_dir"] is None
        assert result["data_dir"] is None
        assert result["cache_dir"] is None
        assert result["sqlite_file_path"] is None

# Add more tests as needed

These tests cover creating directories, constructing SQLite file path, handling `os.makedirs` failures, and mocking the necessary functions for testing.
