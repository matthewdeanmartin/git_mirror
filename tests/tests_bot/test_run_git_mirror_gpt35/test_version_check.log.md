System: You are an excellent python pytest unit test engineer. We are writing pytest tests to get to 90% coverage, so we want 
tests to exercise as many code branches as possible.

First, begin by looking for bugs. There might not be any bugs. If you don't see a specific mistake, don't give me generic code review responses.

Having looked for bugs, write the pytest test as per usual, explaining what you're going to do then write the 
pytest-style unit test. Don't forget to write code!

## Tooling
Use pytest style testing. Use unittest.mock for mocking. pytest, pytest-snapshot, pytest-asyncio, time-machine, pytest-mock are available to use.

Do not, under any circumstances, use unittest.TestCase.

The target python version is 3.10

## common coding issues
Make sure code is cross-platform and does not use linux-only modules. Prefer pathlib.Path whenever possible. When 
using the open() command, always specify the encoding, which should be utf-8 unless something else makes better sense.

## common patterns/antipatterns
Do not write pytest tests in the form of a sample invocation (i.e. not wrapped in a function)
Do make use of the tmp_path fixture for writing files. Do not mock `open` to avoid writing files.

## Env vars
If you need to mock an env var use this, don't invent yet another technique

```
from tests.env_util import temporary_env_var

with temporary_env_var("NAME", "mock_value", "NAME2", "mock_value2"):
	assert os.environ["NAME"] == "mock_value"
	assert os.environ["NAME2"] == "mock_value2"
```

Library is named git_mirror.

    Args:

# Example usage
def display_version_check_message() -> None:
    try:
        package_name = "git_mirror"
        available, new_version = call_pypi_with_version_check(package_name, __version__)
        if available:
            console.print(f"A newer version of {package_name} is available on PyPI. Upgrade to {new_version}.")
    except httpx.HTTPError as e:
        console.print(f"An error occurred while checking the latest version: {e}", style="danger")


```

Here are function and method signatures of the dependencies

```python
#git_mirror/ui.py
def console_with_theme()->Console:
    """Factory to allow for app theming."""
    ...

```
Please write some unit tests for E:\github\git_mirror\git_mirror\version_check.py. If you can't think of anymore unit tests, write "No more unit tests".
Assistant: I don't see any bugs in the `version_check.py` module. Now, I will proceed with writing pytest unit tests for this module to achieve good test coverage. I will mock the external dependencies to isolate the unit tests.

```python
import httpx
from packaging import version
from git_mirror.version_check import call_pypi_with_version_check, display_version_check_message
from git_mirror.__about__ import __version__
from git_mirror.ui import console_with_theme
from unittest.mock import Mock, patch

def test_call_pypi_with_version_check_available_newer_version():
    expected_version = version.parse("2.0.0")
    httpx_response_mock = Mock()
    httpx_response_mock.json.return_value = {"info": {"version": "2.0.0"}}
    httpx_get_mock = Mock(return_value=httpx_response_mock)

    with patch("httpx.get", httpx_get_mock):
        result, new_version = call_pypi_with_version_check("git_mirror", "1.0.0")
        
        assert result is True
        assert new_version == expected_version
        httpx_get_mock.assert_called_once_with("https://pypi.org/pypi/git_mirror/json")
        

def test_call_pypi_with_version_check_no_newer_version():
    httpx_response_mock = Mock()
    httpx_response_mock.json.return_value = {"info": {"version": "1.0.0"}}
    httpx_get_mock = Mock(return_value=httpx_response_mock)

    with patch("httpx.get", httpx_get_mock):
        result, new_version = call_pypi_with_version_check("git_mirror", "2.0.0")
        
        assert result is False
        assert new_version == version.parse("1.0.0")
        httpx_get_mock.assert_called_once_with("https://pypi.org/pypi/git_mirror/json")

def test_call_pypi_with_version_check_http_error():
    httpx_get_mock = Mock(side_effect=httpx.HTTPError)
    
    with patch("httpx.get", httpx_get_mock):
        display_version_check_message()

        # Since an HTTPError occurs, a message about the error should be displayed
        console_with_theme().print.assert_called_once_with("An error occurred while checking the latest version: ", style="danger")

# Additional test scenarios can be added for more thorough testing

# No more unit tests
``` 

In the unit tests above, I have tested the `call_pypi_with_version_check` function for the cases where a newer version is available, no newer version is available, and when an HTTP error occurs. I also tested the `display_version_check_message` function.
