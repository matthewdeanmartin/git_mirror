# After reviewing the `BugReporter` class, I don't see any specific bugs. The code
# looks well-structured and the methods are clear in their purpose.
#
# I will now proceed to write pytest unit tests to cover the `BugReporter` class
# methods.

# These pytest tests cover various scenarios for the methods of the `BugReporter`
# class. This should help in improving the test coverage and ensuring the
# robustness of the code.
