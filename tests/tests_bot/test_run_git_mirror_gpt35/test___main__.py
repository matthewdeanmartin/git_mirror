# Let's start by writing a pytest unit test to cover the `validate_host_token`
# function in `__main__.py`. We will mock necessary dependencies and test the
# different branches of logic based on the input arguments.


# This test mocks the dependencies and covers different scenarios for the
# `validate_host_token` function. We are testing the logic when the host is
# "selfhosted" and "github", as well as handling scenarios where config data is
# not present or tokens need to be setup.
#
# Next unit test, or "No more unit tests"?
# Next, I will write a pytest unit test to cover the `validate_parse_args`
# function in `__main__.py`. This test will focus on verifying the behavior of the
# function when arguments are not provided, and it needs to read from the config
# file.


# This test covers different scenarios for the `validate_parse_args` function by
# mocking the dependencies and checking the behavior when arguments are not
# provided but need to be read from the config file.
#
# Would you like to see the next unit test, or should I stop here with "No more
# unit tests"?
# Certainly! For the next unit test, I will cover the `main` function from
# `__main__.py`. This test will focus on testing the logic of determining the
# program based on the input arguments and handling the case when the user input
# command is in the available choices.


# This test simulates different scenarios for the `main` function in
# `__main__.py`, including determining the program based on the input arguments
# and handling user input commands.
#
# Next unit test, or should I conclude with "No more unit tests"?
# Let's proceed with writing a pytest unit test for the `handle_repos` function in
# `__main__.py`. This test will focus on verifying the correct routing of
# repositories based on the provided arguments and mocked dependencies.
