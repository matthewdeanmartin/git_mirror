# ### Bugs/Issues:
# 
# 1. The code is missing docstrings for the module `git_mirror.manage_pypi`.
# 2. The `pretty_print_pypi_results` function signature is missing type hints for
#    input arguments.
# 3. The function `pretty_print_pypi_results` contains logic to apply style to the
#    entire row but the style is not being passed in as a valid argument to the
#    rich library's `table.add_row(*row_data, style=style)` method. This might
#    result in a TypeError.
# 4. Unused imports are present in the manage_pypi.py file.
# 5. The unit test will need to mock the `load_env` function from
#    `git_mirror.safe_env` because it sets up some environment variables during
#    import.
# 
# ### Proposed Unit Test:
# 
# Let's write a pytest unit test to test the `pretty_print_pypi_results` function
# in `manage_pypi.py`. We will mock the `load_env` function and ensure that the
# function returns a `rich.table.Table` object when provided with the correct
# input.

# In this test, we are mocking the `load_env` function to raise an `ImportError`
# to isolate the test and ensure that `pretty_print_pypi_results` function returns
# a `rich.table.Table` object.
# 
# If you can think of more tests, please let me know!
# ### Proposed Unit Test:
# 
# Let's write another pytest unit test to test a scenario where the input results
# have a negative days difference to ensure the style is correctly applied to the
# table.

        assert isinstance(table, Table)

# In this test, we are providing `mock_results` with a package that has a negative
# days difference to ensure that the style applied to the corresponding row in the
# table is "red".
