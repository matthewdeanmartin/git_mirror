System: You are an excellent python pytest unit test engineer. We are writing pytest tests to get to 90% coverage, so we want 
tests to exercise as many code branches as possible.

First, begin by looking for bugs. There might not be any bugs. If you don't see a specific mistake, don't give me generic code review responses.

Having looked for bugs, write the pytest test as per usual, explaining what you're going to do then write the 
pytest-style unit test. Don't forget to write code!

## Tooling
Use pytest style testing. Use unittest.mock for mocking. pytest, pytest-snapshot, pytest-asyncio, time-machine, pytest-mock are available to use.

Do not, under any circumstances, use unittest.TestCase.

The target python version is 3.10

## common coding issues
Make sure code is cross-platform and does not use linux-only modules. Prefer pathlib.Path whenever possible. When 
using the open() command, always specify the encoding, which should be utf-8 unless something else makes better sense.

## common patterns/antipatterns
Do not write pytest tests in the form of a sample invocation (i.e. not wrapped in a function)
Do make use of the tmp_path fixture for writing files. Do not mock `open` to avoid writing files.

## Env vars
If you need to mock an env var use this, don't invent yet another technique

```
from tests.env_util import temporary_env_var

with temporary_env_var("NAME", "mock_value", "NAME2", "mock_value2"):
	assert os.environ["NAME"] == "mock_value"
	assert os.environ["NAME2"] == "mock_value2"
```

Assistant: ### Bugs
I don't see any bugs in the provided code.

### Unit Test
1. Test that calling `__enter__` method of `Dummy` class does not raise an exception.
2. Test that calling `__exit__` method of `Dummy` class with `None` arguments does not raise an exception.
3. Test that calling `__exit__` method of `Dummy` class with specific arguments does not raise an exception.

```python
from git_mirror.dummies import Dummy

def test_dummy_enter():
    dummy = Dummy()
    try:
        dummy.__enter__()
    except Exception as e:
        assert False, f"Error: {e}"

def test_dummy_exit_none_args():
    dummy = Dummy()
    try:
        dummy.__exit__(None, None, None)
    except Exception as e:
        assert False, f"Error: {e}"

def test_dummy_exit_specific_args():
    dummy = Dummy()
    try:
        dummy.__exit__(ValueError, ValueError("Test"), "<traceback>")
    except Exception as e:
        assert False, f"Error: {e}"
```

### No more unit tests.
User: Excellent. Please write the next unit test. Don't forget, use pytest pytest, pytest-snapshot, pytest-asyncio, time-machine, pytest-mock are available to use.. Use unittest.mock for 
mocking. Prefer Path to str for paths.

If you can't think of anymore unit tests, write just "No more unit tests".
