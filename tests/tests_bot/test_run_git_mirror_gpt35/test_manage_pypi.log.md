System: You are an excellent python pytest unit test engineer. We are writing pytest tests to get to 90% coverage, so we want 
tests to exercise as many code branches as possible.

First, begin by looking for bugs. There might not be any bugs. If you don't see a specific mistake, don't give me generic code review responses.

Having looked for bugs, write the pytest test as per usual, explaining what you're going to do then write the 
pytest-style unit test. Don't forget to write code!

## Tooling
Use pytest style testing. Use unittest.mock for mocking. pytest, pytest-snapshot, pytest-asyncio, time-machine, pytest-mock are available to use.

Do not, under any circumstances, use unittest.TestCase.

The target python version is 3.10

## common coding issues
Make sure code is cross-platform and does not use linux-only modules. Prefer pathlib.Path whenever possible. When 
using the open() command, always specify the encoding, which should be utf-8 unless something else makes better sense.

## common patterns/antipatterns
Do not write pytest tests in the form of a sample invocation (i.e. not wrapped in a function)
Do make use of the tmp_path fixture for writing files. Do not mock `open` to avoid writing files.

## Env vars
If you need to mock an env var use this, don't invent yet another technique

```
from tests.env_util import temporary_env_var

with temporary_env_var("NAME", "mock_value", "NAME2", "mock_value2"):
	assert os.environ["NAME"] == "mock_value"
	assert os.environ["NAME2"] == "mock_value2"
```

    table = Table()

    table.add_column("Package")
    table.add_column("On PyPI")
    table.add_column("Pypi Owner")
    table.add_column("Repo last change date")
    table.add_column("PyPI last change date")
    table.add_column("Days difference")

    for result in results:
        days_difference = int(result.get("Days difference", "0"))
        style = "red" if days_difference * -1 > 60 else ""

        row_data = [
            result["Package"],
            result["On PyPI"],
            result["Pypi Owner"],
            str(result["Repo last change date"]),
            str(result["PyPI last change date"]),
            str(result["Days difference"]),
        ]

        # Apply style to the entire row if needed
        table.add_row(*row_data, style=style)
    return table


```

Here are function and method signatures of the dependencies

```python
#git_mirror/safe_env.py
def load_env()->None:
    ...
def env_info()->None:
    ...

```
Please write some unit tests for E:\github\git_mirror\git_mirror\manage_pypi.py. If you can't think of anymore unit tests, write "No more unit tests".
Assistant: ### Bugs/Issues:

1. The code is missing docstrings for the module `git_mirror.manage_pypi`.
2. The `pretty_print_pypi_results` function signature is missing type hints for input arguments.
3. The function `pretty_print_pypi_results` contains logic to apply style to the entire row but the style is not being passed in as a valid argument to the rich library's `table.add_row(*row_data, style=style)` method. This might result in a TypeError.
4. Unused imports are present in the manage_pypi.py file.
5. The unit test will need to mock the `load_env` function from `git_mirror.safe_env` because it sets up some environment variables during import.

### Proposed Unit Test:

Let's write a pytest unit test to test the `pretty_print_pypi_results` function in `manage_pypi.py`. We will mock the `load_env` function and ensure that the function returns a `rich.table.Table` object when provided with the correct input.

```python
import pytest
from rich.table import Table
from git_mirror.manage_pypi import pretty_print_pypi_results

@pytest.fixture
def mock_results():
    return [
        {
            "Package": "pytest",
            "On PyPI": "7.2.0",
            "Pypi Owner": "pytest-dev",
            "Repo last change date": "2022-01-01",
            "PyPI last change date": "2022-01-01",
            "Days difference": 0
        },
        {
            "Package": "requests",
            "On PyPI": "2.26.0",
            "Pypi Owner": "psf",
            "Repo last change date": "2022-01-01",
            "PyPI last change date": "2022-01-02",
            "Days difference": 1
        }
    ]

def test_pretty_print_pypi_results(mock_results):
    # Mock the load_env function
    with pytest.raises(ImportError):
        from git_mirror import manage_pypi
        with patch("git_mirror.manage_pypi.load_env", autospec=True) as mock_load_env:
            mock_load_env.side_effect = ImportError
            
            # Call the function under test
            table = pretty_print_pypi_results(mock_results)

            # Assertion
            assert isinstance(table, Table)
```

In this test, we are mocking the `load_env` function to raise an `ImportError` to isolate the test and ensure that `pretty_print_pypi_results` function returns a `rich.table.Table` object.

If you can think of more tests, please let me know!
User: Excellent. Please write the next unit test. Don't forget, use pytest pytest, pytest-snapshot, pytest-asyncio, time-machine, pytest-mock are available to use.. Use unittest.mock for 
mocking. Prefer Path to str for paths.

If you can't think of anymore unit tests, write just "No more unit tests".
Assistant: ### Proposed Unit Test:

Let's write another pytest unit test to test a scenario where the input results have a negative days difference to ensure the style is correctly applied to the table.

```python
import pytest
from rich.table import Table
from git_mirror.manage_pypi import pretty_print_pypi_results

@pytest.fixture
def mock_results():
    return [
        {
            "Package": "pytest",
            "On PyPI": "7.2.0",
            "Pypi Owner": "pytest-dev",
            "Repo last change date": "2022-01-01",
            "PyPI last change date": "2022-01-01",
            "Days difference": -70
        }
    ]

def test_pretty_print_pypi_results_negative_difference_style(mock_results):
    # Mock the load_env function
    with patch("git_mirror.manage_pypi.load_env", autospec=True):
        from git_mirror.manage_pypi import pretty_print_pypi_results

        # Call the function under test
        table = pretty_print_pypi_results(mock_results)

        # Assertion
        assert isinstance(table, Table)
        assert table.row_styles and table.row_styles[0] == "red"

```

In this test, we are providing `mock_results` with a package that has a negative days difference to ensure that the style applied to the corresponding row in the table is "red". 

If you need more tests or have any specific scenarios in mind, feel free to let me know!
