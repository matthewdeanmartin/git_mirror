## Host support

- Private Gitlab
  - Need to disambiguate the gitlabs (currently, just "selfhosted")
  - Check if any non-github hosts are github api compatible (probably not)
- Bitbucket

## TODO

- "sync set of files", like project boilerplate
- Verify it works with "cli to website" tools

## Config

- Add tag filtering to app so that action only applied to tag
- Implement "do_not_clone" attribute to skip them.
- Implement "remove_local" - skip and delete

## Plugins?

- hook for new specific command
- hook for new host
